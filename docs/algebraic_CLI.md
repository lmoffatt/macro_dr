## ðŸ§¾â€¯**Algebraic CLI: Diagnosing Inference Engines as Structured Tasks**

This CLI does not expose loose functions. Each command represents an *algebraic operator within a coherent functional structure* that reflects the internal organization of the MacroIR inference engine.

Just as a mathematical group consists of operations satisfying structural laws, this CLI organizes commands like `simulate`, `infer`, `evidence`, `sav-check`, and `fim-check` into *functionally coordinated families* â€” with approximate identities and structural reversibility.

This CLI is not just a control surface. It serves to demonstrate that `macro_dr` is a **mathematical instrument**, not a bundle of scripts. Structures are tested not because we distrust them, but because their *internal coherence is their meaning*.

Running `simulate`, then `infer`, then `sav-check` is an algebraic move: it defines a morphism, its approximate inverse, and a coherence verification:

```
infer(simulate(Î¸)) â‰ˆ Î¸       (validated by sav-check)
```

Therefore, this CLI:

* Acts as a test sheet for the structural integrity of the inference engine.
* Serves as a practical introduction to new users.
* Anticipates the full HoTTification, by showing that algebraic contracts already govern the system even before type-theoretic formalization.

This program is not merely executed. It is tuned.

Let me know if you'd like a version with CLI examples (e.g. actual `macro_dr --simulate ...`) or YAML snippets that match this philosophy.
