# Performance Metrics

This directory stores lightweight performance summaries generated by CI.  The
figures are intentionally compact so they can be tracked in the main branch.

- `compile/` — aggregated compilation timings extracted from Ninja logs.  CI
  appends rows to the CSVs, one per translation unit and one per build run.
- `runtime/` — reserved for future execution-time statistics (e.g., benchmark
  results).

Files inside this tree are append-only; do not rewrite history so we keep a
stable record of trends.
