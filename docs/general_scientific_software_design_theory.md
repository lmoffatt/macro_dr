# A General Theory of Correctness‑Driven Scientific Software Design

---

## 0. Preface

This document synthesises the full conceptual framework developed across the previous design notes (Proof‑Oriented Design, HoTT Contagion, Contagiously Safe Design, Safety Explosion Limit, Combinatorial Limit, Composite Safety Domains).  Together they form a **unified theory** for building *mathematically trustworthy yet computationally feasible* scientific software.

## 1. Core Axiom

> **A scientific program is a constructive proof of its governing invariants.**
>
> Correctness is not an after‑thought; it is the *essence* of the code.

From this axiom every subsequent construct follows.

---

## 2. Pillars of the Theory

| Pillar | Essence | Key Contribution |
| ------ | ------- | ---------------- |
| **Proof‑Oriented Design (POD)** | Types ≍ Propositions; construction ≍ proof | Encodes invariants directly into types |
| **HoTT Contagion** | Once a value is proof‑safe, downstream code *must* remain proof‑safe | Guarantees closure under composition |
| **Contagiously Safe Design (CSD)** | Wrap values in safety envelopes that propagate automatically | Provides a mechanical realisation of contagion |
| **Safety Explosion Limit (SEL)** | Full orthogonal safety → exponential type growth | Exposes the computational cost of full correctness |
| **Combinatorial Limit of Type Systems (CLTS)** | Type explosion is a universal information‑theoretic law | Places a fundamental ceiling on expressiveness vs. tractability |
| **Composite Safety Domains (CSD‑²)** | Bundle multiple invariants into coarse, atomic safety zones | Restores scalability while preserving contagion |

## 3. Design Stack (from abstract to concrete)

```text
Scientific Theory
    ↓  (Formal invariants)
Proof‑Oriented Design (types = proofs)
    ↓  (constructive objects)
HoTT Contagion (closure)
    ↓  (mechanical enforcement)
Contagiously Safe Design (safety envelopes)
    ↓  (awareness of explosion)
Safety Explosion Limit  ⇆  Combinatorial Limit
    ↓  (granularity trade‑off)
Composite Safety Domains (coarsened bundles)
    ↓  (implementation)
Executable Scientific Software (MacroIR++ et al.)
```

## 4. The Universal Law

> **Correctness, compositionality and scalability cannot be simultaneously maximised.**
>
> One must choose a *point on the Pareto surface* between mathematical purity and engineering feasibility.

Our framework provides the levers to navigate that surface deliberately.

## 5. Engineering Guidelines

1. **Identify foundational invariants** of the scientific domain.
2. **Encode** those invariants as *strong types* (POD).
3. **Wrap** computations in safety envelopes that enforce HoTT‑style contagion (CSD).
4. **Monitor** type growth relative to SEL & CLTS.
5. **Coarsen** safety granularity using Composite Safety Domains when explosion threatens compile time.
6. **Optional** – augment with external proof tools for properties too expensive to track in‑type.

## 6. Language Mapping Cheatsheet

| Language | Native Support Level | Notes |
| -------- | ------------------- | ----- |
| C++20/23 | Templates + Concepts | Powerful but discipline required; composite domains recommended |
| Rust | Traits + Ownership | Strong compiler enforcement; ideal for CSD |
| Haskell | Type‑classes + Kinds | Excellent for purity, moderate runtime perf |
| Idris / Agda | Dependent Types | Gold‑standard proofs; runtime perf low |

## 7. Example Minimal Kernel (pseudo‑C++)

```cpp
// Composite safety bundle for MacroIR numerical models
template<typename ModelT>
struct ScientificSafe {
    ModelT value;            // Proven: HoTT‑safe, units‑consistent, mem‑safe, numerically‑stable
private:
    ScientificSafe(ModelT v) : value(std::move(v)) {}
public:
    // Factory enforces all proofs during construction
    static expected<ScientificSafe, Error> create(ModelT raw);
};

// Invariant‑preserving operation
ScientificSafe<ModelOut>
propagate(const ScientificSafe<ModelIn>& m, const Params& p);
```

All downstream code **must** consume/return `ScientificSafe<⋯>`; thus contagion is preserved while the type graph remains linear.

---

## 8. Research & Tooling Agenda

1. **Prototype** C++20/23 or Rust kernels.
2. **Benchmarks** comparing fine‑grained vs. composite domains.
3. **Static analysis** helpers to detect accidental safety escapes.
4. **Tutorial paper / conference talk** formalising the theory.
5. **Reference implementation** integrated into MacroIR pipeline.

---

## 9. Conclusion

We have articulated a self‑consistent theory unifying mathematical proof, category‑theoretic closure, type‑system engineering and practical software scalability.  The framework provides a roadmap for building high‑integrity scientific codebases that balance **truth**, **trust**, and **tractability**.
